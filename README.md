#A Simple Platform for Launching Meme Tokens
Our platform enables the quick and easy creation of meme tokens, with an intuitive interface and a streamlined process.

#Key Features:
Uniswap Integration: We use the Uniswap interface to create liquidity pairs (Pair) and the router, giving meme tokens their own dedicated space, similar to a DEX for meme coins. You can refer to the documentation at Uniswap Docs.

Decentralized Storage on IPFS: Token images are stored in a decentralized manner on IPFS, ensuring data security and integrity. During deployment, only the CID of the image is stored on-chain, optimizing the use of smart contract space.

Data Indexing with Subsquid: To ensure efficient access and querying of on-chain data, we use Subsquid as our indexing solution. Subsquid enables fast and scalable extraction of blockchain data, providing users with a real-time, seamless experience. It supports detailed queries and displays information such as transactions, token creation, and liquidity pair movements, ensuring full transparency and seamless integration of platform data.
